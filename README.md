# Weather-App

Create a Weather App Website using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I get the current weather data from Fess API from OpenWeatherMap and display the weather information like Temperature, Weather condition, humidity and wind speed according to the city on our website or app. 

Then we will display the weather info on website from Free API using Javascript. In this weather app, we will add one search box where user can enter the city name and get the weather information of the particular city.
